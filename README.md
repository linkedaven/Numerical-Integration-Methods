# ODE Solvers Comparison

A from-scratch implementation and comparison of six numerical methods for
solving ordinary differential equations:

- **Euler method** — explicit forward Euler (1st order)
- **Modified Euler method** — Heun's predictor-corrector (2nd order)
- **RK2** — midpoint method (2nd order)
- **RK4** — classic 4-stage Runge-Kutta (4th order)
- **RKF45** — Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg, embedded 4th/5th order with adaptive
  step size
- **DOP853** — Dormand-Prince 8th order, adaptive (via
  `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, since its ~13-stage Butcher tableau isn't
  practical to hand-code)

All six solvers are run on the same test problem, and their accuracy is
compared against the known closed-form solution.

## Output

![Solution and error comparison plots](assets/demo.gif)

*Left: the six numerical solutions vs. the exact solution. Right: each
method's error over time on a log scale.*

## Features

- Each method implemented as its own function with a shared signature
  (`solver(f, t0, y0, t_end, h)`), so any of them can be dropped into a
  different ODE or system of ODEs
- Works for both scalar and vector-valued `y`, since state is handled as a
  NumPy array internally
- Adaptive step-size control for RKF45, implemented from the classic
  Fehlberg coefficients (Butcher tableau)
- Side-by-side accuracy comparison: a results table (final value, error,
  steps used) plus solution and error-vs-time plots

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
